A personal webpage to host all my notes on things that might be useful to my future self or my class mates.
- I dont know a good way to organise it yet. Right now its essentially just a long list.
- I would like my other coding projects to be hosted on the web and accessable through this site.
- I would like to impliment some ideas from the indie web, like a visitor book.
- I would like to have some more art or something, make it visually interesting.
