A personal webpage to host all my notes on things that might be useful to my future self or my class mates.
- I would like my other coding projects to be hosted on the web and accessable through this site.
- I would like to have some more art or something, make it visually interesting. more ascii flourishes seems good.
- I had the idea to make it look like a new bulletin, scrolling text, flashing banners, anchor person in the middle.
