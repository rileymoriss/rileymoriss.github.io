    <p>It always annoyed me how Justified True Belief (JTB) was introduced as a response to the classical conception
        of knowledge; you can go and read the texts and they never mention it, Plato as explicitly as Plato does rejects
        it. This framing however is pushed and its prevents a proper analysis of what the tradition actually was. I
        found a good article discussing how this myth came to be, what the actual tradition may have been and just what
        Gettier was responding to (since it cannot have been the traditional conception of knowledge):
