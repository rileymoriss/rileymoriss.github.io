    <h2>Good Exposition</h2>
      Timothy Chow in <a href="http://timothychow.net/forcing.pdf">his article on forcing</a> expresses his idea of an
      "open exposition problem". I think that his remarks about what makes a good exposition are seldom instantiated in
      the mathematical literature, I would like to record them here as a reminder to myself what I should aim for when
      giving talks and presentations and writing exposition.

      <p style="margin-left: 25px;"><i>All mathematicians are familiar with the concept of an open research problem.
          I propose the less familiar concept of an open exposition problem. Solving an open
          exposition problem means explaining a mathematical subject in a way that renders
          it totally perspicuous. Every step should be motivated and clear; ideally, students
          should feel that they could have arrived at the results themselves. The proofs
          should be “natural” in Donald Newman’s sense (Analytic Number Theory, Springer-Verlag, 1998):
          This term . . . is introduced to mean not having any ad hoc constructions or brilliancies. A “natural” proof,
          then, is one which
          proves itself, one available to the “common mathematician in the
          streets.”</i></p>
      <p>Some other things to bear in mind are </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Every time you name something, explain why; if it is a later result reference it, if it is historical,
          annological, explain it.</li>
        <li>Every time you make a simplifying assumption explain how the general case can be reduced to it; if it cannot
          remark on this as well, it is ok to make assumptions just so we can get an idea, but be clear about WHY we
          make the assumption.</li>
      </ul>
